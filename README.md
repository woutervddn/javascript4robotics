# About this Repo
This repo is the codebase for the **Javascript4Robotics** project. **Javascript3Robotics** is a subproject that is part of the **Engineering Project** from **PXL University College** department **Tech**.

# Requirements
- Have Node.js installed on either a Raspberry Pi, Arduino Yun or a PC with an Arduino connected to it.
- Have npm installed


# Installation
For now the whole project is fairly vanilla, installing the required modules is as simple as running `npm install` from inside the `/src/` directory.

# Running the code
You can run our code by launching your node.js server. Do this by running either:

    node /folderPath/src/app.js

or running:

    nodejs /folderPath/src/app.js


**Whether your computer uses the `node` or `nodejs`command depends on your operating system.**
